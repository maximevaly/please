        Hi! I'm a programmer, the kind that types cryptic code on a computer all day.
        But I could be a designer expressing an idea into shapes and colors, an accountant 
        crunching numbers, a copy writer fighting akward grammar, a student reading
        a book on an obscure topic: the important thing is <em>I'm working on something, trying 
        to solve a problem, and I'm concentrated</em>.
                        </p>

                        The costs of interruptions have been studied in office environments. An interrupted
task is estimated to take twice as long and contain twice as many errors as
uninterrupted tasks (Czerwinski:04). Workers have to work in a fragmented
state as 57% of tasks are interrupted (Mark:05).

                        And then someone comes and taps on my shoulder to say hi. Starts talking to
me, despite the music in my headphones, to know if I saw the game yesterday.
Asks me if I received the mail about this meeting at the end of next week. Or if 
I know if that other colleague will be there today. To put it shortly: <em>someone 
interrupts me</em>.

        A programmer takes between 10-15 minutes to start editing code after resuming
        work from an interruption. When interrupted during an edit of a method, only
        10% of times did a programmer resume work in less than a minute. A programmer
        is likely to get just one uninterrupted 2-hour session in a day.

                        Don't get me wrong: I enjoy talking with people, joking,
exchanging ideas, but when I'm working I need to be immersed in my
problems. It might look like I'm staring blankly at my screen but believe me: I
have something in mind.

                        The trick here is that when you manage programmers, specifically, task
switches take a really, really, really long time. That's because programming
is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at
once. The more things you remember at once, the more productive you are at
programming.

                        Interruptions, like multi-tasking, don't help getting
                        things done. They dumb people down.
                        </p>
                        <p class="quotes">
                        Interruptions break your workday into a series of work moments. Forty-five
minutes and then you have a call. Fifteen minutes and then you have lunch. An
hour later, you have an afternoon meeting. Before you know it, it's five
o'clock, and you've only had a couple uninterrupted hours to get your work
done. You can't get meaningful things done when you're constantly going start,
stop, start, stop.

                        <p class="quotes">
                        Getting into that zone takes time and requires avoiding interruptions. It's
like REM sleep: You don't just go directly into REM sleep. You go to sleep
first and then make your way to REM. Any interruptions force you to start
over. And just as REM is when the real sleep magic happens, the alone zone is
where the real productivity magic happens.

                        How to avoid that? Here comes empathy. Ask yourself: in her position, would I 
                        like to be interrupted? Is this thing so urgent?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the answers are "yes" go on, pick-up your phone or go talk directly with 
                            your co-worker. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If not, send an email, use IM, wait for the next coffee break. Showing a bit of patience will help your colleague in her work and in the meantime you can focus on another task until you have your answer.
